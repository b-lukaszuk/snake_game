# snake_game

My take on classical [sname game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)).
It will be no big deal, but still I hope it will be playable.
For practice I wrote it with [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of Vanilla JS.
